    <h2>NEW VENTURES</h2>
    <p>I attended the opening of cairo design week yesterday in korba , cairo design week is a time for brands to come together and showcase their new releases and their new products. One thing i have noticed this year is the Homage that multiple brands are paying to ancient egyptian history and culture. this ranges from jewlery to dresses to real archelogiocal sights. this leads me to wonder if the great uprise in the interset in ancient egyptian history will reflect in upcoming campaigns</p>
