<p>Date :february,5th,2018
    Concept : since Pepsico,the mother company , owns both Mountain Dew and Doritos we decided to merge both ADs in one and create a dual interactive campaign inspired by the game of thrones. The name comes from a song that was in the series game of thrones which was highly anticipated for its 8th season release .
    Cast :Peter Dinklage,Morgan Freeman,Missy Elliot,and Busta Rhymes .
    Script : Peter Dinklage will be in team fire and will be advertising doritos while rapping to Busta Rhymesâ€™s most famous song while Morgan Freeman does the same but to Missy Elliot's song while drinking a mountain dew .</p>
